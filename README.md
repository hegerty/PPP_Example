# Purchasing Power Parity: Data Example
This is the Purchasing Power Parity example I use in Economics 321 (International Monetary Theory) and Economics 343 (Macroeconomic Data Analysis). I dust it off for other courses as well!

It shows how to manage a dataset and calculate some simple statistics, as well as generate graphs and tables using R. At the same time, it demonstrates the relationship between two countries' inflation differentials and appreciation in the exchange rate&mdash;the so-called "relative" PPP condition.
